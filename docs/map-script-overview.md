# Map Front-End Script Overview

This script (`trr-script.js`) provides the interactive logic for The Roseburg Receiverâ€™s outage & incident map. It is responsible for:

- Initializing and rendering the Leaflet map (with OpenStreetMap tiles)
- Fetching, displaying, and refreshing layers for:
  - Power outages (Pacific Power, Douglas Electric, Central Lincoln, Coos-Curry)
  - ODOT traffic incidents
  - Road cameras (CCTV)
  - Dynamic message signs (DMS)
  - Oregon mileposts (text markers)
- Handling custom SVG marker icons for incidents, cameras, signs, etc.
- Managing map legend state, tabs, and user toggles (persisted with localStorage)
- Drawing county polygons and summarizing outage counts by county/utility
- Providing a responsive, mobile-friendly experience
- Efficiently updating data and UI in real time without overwhelming the browser

**Customization:**  
Developers can easily add/modify county styles, SVG icons, polling rates, and new data sources by adjusting parameters in this script.  
All UI states are persisted, so user preferences remain after reload.
